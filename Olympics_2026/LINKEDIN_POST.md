# LinkedIn Post - Milano-Cortina 2026 Olympics Dashboard

🏅 **Excited to share my latest project: Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics Dashboard!** ⛷️

Just in time for the upcoming Winter Olympics, I built an interactive data dashboard to explore all 608+ events across 16 winter sports competing in Milano-Cortina 2026.

**🛠️ Technologies & Skills Applied:**

✅ **REST API Integration** – Integrated with the Milano-Cortina 2026 Olympics API to fetch real-time event data, implementing robust error handling and authentication

✅ **Python Development** – Built the entire backend using Python 3.12, leveraging object-oriented programming principles and efficient data structures

✅ **Streamlit Framework** – Created an intuitive, responsive web dashboard that makes complex Olympic data accessible and engaging

✅ **Data Engineering** – Designed ETL pipelines to clean, transform, and categorize raw API data into meaningful insights

✅ **Data Visualization** – Developed interactive Plotly charts with smart categorization (splitting Freestyle Skiing into 7 disciplines and Livigno venues into 5 specialized areas)

✅ **Performance Optimization** – Implemented smart caching strategies with TTL expiration for optimal API usage and fast load times

✅ **Cloud Deployment** – Deployed to Streamlit Cloud with proper secrets management

**📊 Key Features:**
- Filter 608+ Olympic events by date and sport
- Interactive visualizations showing event distribution across disciplines and venues  
- Detailed descriptions for all 16 Olympic sports
- Export functionality for data analysis
- Timezone-aware datetime handling (CET)

**💡 What I learned:**
Working with external APIs in production environments requires thoughtful error handling, caching strategies, and data validation. Breaking down complex datasets (like Freestyle events) into granular categories creates much more meaningful visualizations.

**🎯 The Challenge:**
Transform raw Olympic API data into an intuitive dashboard that helps fans and analysts explore the Games. The solution needed to handle 90+ nations, 16 sports, and hundreds of events while remaining fast and user-friendly.

The dashboard is live and ready for the Opening Ceremony on February 6! 🎿🏒⛸️
